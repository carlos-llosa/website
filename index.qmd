## Bio

I obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. in Statistics from [Iowa State University](https://www.stat.iastate.edu) in 2018 and 2022, respectively, and I received the B.S. degree from [The University of Arizona](https://www.math.arizona.edu/) in 2015. My dissertation was advised by Ranjan Maitra on the statistical analysis of tensor-valued data. Currently, I am a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM

My main interest lies in the area of multilinear statistics, or the statistical analysis of tensor-valued data. This involves creating new models for tensor data, and also studying existing tensor models from a statistical perspective. More generally, I am interested in the statistical analysis of complex data structures, including functional, spatial, temporal, and tensor-variate data, particularly at the intersections of two or more of these domains.
