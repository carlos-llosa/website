## Bio

I obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Statistics from [Iowa State University](https://www.stat.iastate.edu) in 2018 and 2022, respectively, and I received the B.S. degree in Mathematics from [The University of Arizona](https://www.math.arizona.edu/) in 2015. My dissertation was advised by [Ranjan Maitra](https://www.stat.iastate.edu/people/ranjan-maitra) on the statistical analysis of tensor-valued data. Currently, I am a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at the Department of Statistical Sciences at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM.

My main interest lies in the area of multilinear statistics, or the statistical analysis of tensor-valued data. This involves creating new models for tensor data, and also studying existing tensor models from a statistical perspective. More generally, I am interested in the statistical analysis of complex data structures, including functional, spatial, temporal, and tensor-variate data, particularly at the intersections of two or more of these domains.
