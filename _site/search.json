My dissertation was advised by Ranjan Maitra on the statistical analysis of tensor-valued data. Currently, I am a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM\nMy main interest lies in the area of multilinear statistics, or the statistical analysis of tensor-valued data. This involves creating new models for tensor data, and also studying existing tensor models from a statistical perspective. More generally, I am interested in the statistical analysis of complex data structures, including functional, spatial, temporal, and tensor-variate data, particularly at the intersections of two or more of these domains.\n\n\n\nMy full CV is available here.\nIowa State University Ames, IA\nPh.D. in Statistics | May 2018 - May 2022\nM.S. in Statistics | August 2016 - May 2018\nThe University of Arizona Tucson, AZ\nB.S. in Mathematics | August 2011- May 2015\n\n\n\nCarlos Llosa\nStatistical Sciences\nSandia National Laboratories\nPO Box 5800 MS 0829\nAlbuquerque, NM 87185\nEmail SNL: cjllosa@sandia.gov\nPhone: 505-844-2540"
