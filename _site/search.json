My dissertation was advised by Ranjan Maitra on the statistical analysis of tensor-valued data. Currently, I am a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at the Department of Statistical Sciences at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM.\nMy main interest lies in the area of multilinear statistics, or the statistical analysis of tensor-valued data. This involves creating new models for tensor data, and also studying existing tensor models from a statistical perspective. More generally, I am interested in the statistical analysis of complex data structures, including functional, spatial, temporal, and tensor-variate data, particularly at the intersections of two or more of these domains.\n\n\n\nMy full CV will be available here.\nIowa State University Ames, IA\nPh.D. in Statistics | May 2018 - May 2022\nM.S. in Statistics | August 2016 - May 2018\nThe University of Arizona Tucson, AZ\nB.S. in Mathematics | August 2011- May 2015\n\n\n\nCarlos Llosa\nStatistical Sciences\nSandia National Laboratories\nPO Box 5800 MS 0829\nAlbuquerque, NM 87185\nEmail SNL: cjllosa@sandia.gov\nPhone: 505-844-2540"
