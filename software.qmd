## `totr`
I'm lead author of the `totr` R package ([GitHub](https://github.com/carlos-llosa/totr)). 

This package performs Gaussian linear regression with tensor responses and tensor covariates. This implementation allows modeling the entry-to-entry correlation in the response tensor, and allows for four different types of low-rank regression coefficients.
